quiz is a game which can also be called a mind sport wherein the players, either as 
individuals or in teams attempt to answer questions posed to them correctly, in order to 
win a prize. I’m sure that we are all familiar with popular quizzes like the Limca quiz 
or the Cadbury Bournvita Quiz Contest (BQC). These are but just a few examples of quiz 
competitions that are held. Over the years people have been fascinated by these quizzes 
which have been broad – casted on television sets. And are still watched and enjoyed by 
children and adults alike even today!
